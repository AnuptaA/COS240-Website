        <h1>LECTURES</h1>
        <p>
          You are required to attend the lectures. Your lecture attendance and
          participation are important to your success in the course. Some of the
          material covered in lectures may not be covered in the textbooks or
          precepts. Some exam questions may reward your lecture attendance.

      <section class="Precepts" id="precept-pol">
        <h1>PRECEPTS</h1>
        <p>
          You are required to attend the precepts. We also encourage you to
          participate actively in the precepts by listening attentively, asking
          helpful questions occasionally, answering questions occasionally, and
          so forth. Your precept attendance and participation are important to
          your success in the course and may also affect your
          <a href="#grades">grade</a>. They also are important to the success of
          the course as a whole. You should attend your precept, that is, the
          precept for which you are registered in Princeton's TigerHub
          system.<br />
          <br />
          Note: Some of the material covered in precepts may not be covered in
          the textbooks or lectures.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          Concerning attending another precept <i>instead of</i> your precept:
        </h4>
        <p>
          Generally it is not acceptable to attend another precept instead of
          your precept. However, it is acceptable to attend another precept
          instead of your precept <i>occasionally</i> if a conflict with your
          precept arises (indeed you should do so). In this case, as soon as you
          become aware of the conflict, send an email to your preceptor and the
          other preceptor. Note that this mechanism is intended to address
          occasional conflicts; it does not provide a license to attend precepts
          other than your precept on a regular basis.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          Concerning attending another precept <i>in addition to</i> your
          precept:
        </h4>
        <p>
          Generally it is not acceptable to attend another precept in addition
          to your precept. After all, if even a small fraction of the course's
          students did that routinely, then some precepts would become very
          large (or even overflow) routinely. Precepts containing a large number
          of students are less effective than those containing a small number.
          However, it could be acceptable to attend another precept in addition
          to your own <i>occasionally</i>. In this case, send an email to your
          preceptor and the other preceptor the day before the precept, asking
          for permission to attend. The preceptors then will make the decision
          and let you know.

          These are the course's policies concerning electronic communication:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you have a question about course policies, don't post it on
            Piazza. Instead email (or visit the office hours of) your preceptor
            or the instructor of the course.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have a question (unrelated to course policies) that you can
            express

              >without revealing any parts of your assignment (also known as
              problem set) solution</i
            >, then you may post it to the course's Piazza account. One of the
            course's instructors will respond as soon as possible. Other
            students also are welcome to respond if and only if they can do so
            <i>without revealing any of their assignment solutions</i>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have a question that you cannot express without revealing any
            part of your assignment solution, then you may not post it to
            Piazza. Instead you may email it to your preceptor. See the
            <a href="index.html">General Information</a> page for the email
            address of your Preceptor. You may not email questions directly to a
            Preceptor other than your own.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the context of electronic communication, the phrase "any part of
          your assignment solution" includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <i>products</i> that you create for the assignment, that is,
            your .tex code files (including parts of it), pdf files containing
            parts or the whole solution of a problem included in an assignment,
            your notes taken for the purpose of completing the assignment, etc.
            You may not show any of the products that you create for the
            assignment, modified versions of them, or any parts of them, openly
            (for instance on a post where other students have access to) on
            Piazza.

          <li>
            <i>Descriptions of those products</i> in the form of natural
            language prose, etc. You may not describe the solutions that you
            write for the assignment, or any parts of them, openly (for instance
            on a post where other students have access to) on Piazza.

            express your the logic of your solution or a part of it. You may not
            describe such decisions or suggest this kind of decisions openly

      <section class="Assignment-Conduct">
        <h1>ASSIGNMENT CONDUCT</h1>
        <p>
          Unless an assignment is marked as a <i>no-collaboration</i> assignment
          in which case you may only discuss the problems in that assignment
          with course staff, you may collaborate in groups of at most three
          students of the course to solve assignment problems. In the case of
          assignments that allow collaboration, the same group of (at most
          three) students of the course should collaborate in all problems of
          that assignment. After discussing with your collaborators, you must
          type your own solutions. You must write <i>all</i> the names of your
          collaborators at the start of your solutions for that assignment.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you did not collaborate with anyone, you must clearly state it at
          the start of your solutions for that assignment, writing for example
          <i>''Collaborators: None''</i> at the start of your solutions for that
          assignment. You are not allowed to discuss your solutions outside of
          your group. However, you may discuss your solutions with the
          instructor of the course, any of the preceptors of the course and the
          Lab TAs; see the <a href="index.html">General Information</a> page for
          information on the teaching staff of the course. Any notes taken
          during your discussions should be discarded after the discussions are
          over and before you write your solution. After you finished your
          discussions, you should write your own solutions in <i>isolation</i>.
          Being together (even in an online setting and with your group members
          or other students of the course) and writing/typing solutions is
          strictly prohibited.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You may consult the course reading material (distributed only in this
          semester's course Piazza account) to solve assignment problems.
          Furthermore you can consult external sources to learn the course
          material and to solve assignments, with the understanding that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you used any external sources to solve assignment problems (e.g.
            other textbooks, wikipedia, material from other courses) you must
            clearly mention them at the beginning of your solution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some assignments restrict available sources; you may use only the
            sources listed in those assignments.
          </li>
          <li>
            In all cases, you may not consult material posted in previous
            semesters' course Piazza accounts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Furthermore, you may not consult material that reveal parts of the
            assignment solutions beyond the ones the course's teaching staff may
            post on Piazza.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may not use AI composition software (such as ChatGPT) for the
            purpose of solving assignments. You are permitted to use though the
            basic functionality of a calculator, namely you may only use the
            basic math functions on the calculator (i.e., plus, times, log, sin,
            exp, etc.); you may not use any programming functionality.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Sharing your assignment solutions with another student is an
          especially egregious violation of course policies. Do not give hard
          copy of your work to anyone. Do not e-mail your work to anyone. Do not
          make your work available to anyone via the web.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There will be several problems in each assignment. You
          <i
            >must type your solutions to the problems of the assignment on one
            PDF file</i
          >. You may use the provided LaTeX templates to type in your solutions.
          Write
          <i
            >your name, assignment number, and names of your collaborators at
            the start of the PDF file</i
          >
          containing your solutions for the assignment.

        <h4>Concerning Retaking COS240:</h4>
        <p>
          If you took COS 240 (or part of it) during a previous semester, then
          you may use your work on assignments from that previous semester.
          However:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You may not look at the feedback on your old graded reports.</li>
          <li>
            You may not look at any course material (solutions to assignments,
            precept material, etc) you may have had access to while enrolled in
            a previous semester.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may not use your work on an assignment from a previous semester
            if you violated course policies or University policies on that
            assignment, as determined by the course's instructors or the
            Committee on Discipline.

      <section class="Exam-Conduct">
        <h1>EXAM CONDUCT</h1>
        <p>
          Conduct during in-class exams is covered by the University Honor Code.
          If we suspect a student of inappropriate conduct during an in-class
          exam, we will refer the case to the Honor Committee. If the Honor
          Committee finds the student guilty of inappropriate conduct, the
          standard penalty is automatic failure of the COS240 course. The Honor
          Committee may impose additional penalties.

      <section class="Submitting-Assignments">
        <h1>SUBMITTING ASSIGNMENTS</h1>
        <p>
          You must submit <i>all</i> your solutions to an assignment
          <i>electronically</i> as one PDF file using the link to the TigerFile
          service posted in the relevant Piazza thread.

      <section class="Assignment-Late-Submission">
        <h1>ASSIGNMENT LATE SUBMISSION</h1>
        <p>
          You may use up to 4 late days throughout the semester, but not more
          than 2 days on a given assignment. Using one late day on an assignment
          extends the due date/time of that assignment by 24 hours. Using two
          late days on an assignment extends the due date/time of that
          assignment by 48 hours. On each instance, you may only use an integer
          number of late days. Your late days' usage up to and including the
          current assignment is posted on Canvas after you submit your solutions
          to the problems of that assignment.

          <i
            >Outside of this policy, no late submissions will be accepted unless
            there are extraordinary circumstances involved</i
          >. We will grant extensions only in the case of illness (with a
          doctor's note) or other extraordinary circumstances. If illness or
          other extraordinary circumstances will cause you to submit an
          assignment late, then you should discuss the matter with your
          preceptor as soon as possible (before that assignment's deadline has
          passed). Please plan your work on the assignments so that travel,
          religious holidays, etc. do not cause you to submit it late. Heavy
          workload is not an extraordinary circumstance.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you wish to remove an assignment file that you submitted, you can
          only do so before 48 hours have passed after this assignment's
          deadline. This time period you have to remove an assignment file you
          submitted is not affected by any late days you may have used on this
          assignment.

          There will be 5 assignments (Problem Sets). Each assignment will

          no-collaboration assignment (the first one). The ''Assignments'' grade
          will be calculated as follows: (0.25 * Your Lowest Assignment Score +
          Sum of Your Remaining Assignment Scores) / 4.25.

        <p>
          Your ''Participation'' grade will be the maximum possible if you
          attend at least 18 lectures and 7 precepts. On the other hand, it will
          be 0 if you attend less than 13 lectures or less than 6 precepts. Note
          that if you attend on 5 or more occasions precepts that you are not
          enrolled in, your participation score will be 0, since this implies
          that you attended precepts other than your own on a regular basis
          contrary to the rules in the
